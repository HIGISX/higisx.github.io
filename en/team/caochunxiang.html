In 2012, she was awarded the title of "Ambassador for the 12th New Century Women's Health and Lifestyle Public Service Activity" by the All-China Women's Federation. In 2017, she was the sole professor from the University of the Chinese Academy of Sciences chosen to accompany CAS President Bai Chunli and UCAS President Ding Zhongli in hosting Thai Princess Maha Chakri Sirindhorn. That same year, as a representative of CAS, she participated in the UNCCD-COP13 as a member of the national negotiation delegation and received the "Belt and Road Green Pioneer Award" from the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification.
                                                        In 2024, Dr. Cao was recognized with the "Chief Scientist Certificate in Environmental Health Remote Sensing Diagnosis" by the AIRCAS.</p>
                                                    <p>In scientific research, Dr. Cao Chunxiang established the interdisciplinary field of "Environmental Health Remote Sensing Diagnosis," elevating China to a leading position globally in this domain. Her pioneering work has integrated remote sensing diagnosis into environmental health research, achieving the development of a comprehensive framework, indicator systems, key technologies, and diagnostic systems for environmental health remote sensing diagnosis. This has provided scientific support for real-time, integrated environmental health diagnostics across typical regions in China and around the world.
                                                        Under her leadership, the team has published nearly 300 papers, led or participated in over 40 national and ministerial-level projects, secured 12 software copyrights, filed or received 14 patents, and published or co-authored 15 books. Additionally, they have organized six special journal issues. To establish a branded academic conference for China, Dr. Cao has successfully hosted 10 "International Symposia on Environmental Health Remote Sensing Diagnosis" and a series of academic discussions since 2011, with broad support from society.
                                                        Over a decade of effort, Dr. Cao also developed the world's first portable "Multi-Parameter Intelligent Environmental Health Remote Sensing Diagnostic Device" to further apply research findings in environmental health remote sensing diagnosis effectively.</p>
                                                    <p>In talent cultivation and academic exchange, Dr. Cao Chunxiang launched the first doctoral-level course on "Environmental Health Remote Sensing Diagnosis" at the University of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, marking a global debut for this specialized curriculum. She has meticulously trained over 70 graduate students and interns, including international students from the United States, Iran, Thailand, Pakistan, Nepal, Mongolia, Indonesia, and Sri Lanka, alongside domestic students. Additionally, she has led the training of more than 3,000 professionals in remote sensing diagnosis technologies for industry and government sectors.
                                                        Dr. Cao has delivered over 100 academic presentations both domestically and internationally. She was also honored as the "Ambassador for the 12th New Century Women's Health and Lifestyle Public Service Activity" in China, recognizing her contributions to societal well-being and education.</p>
                                                    <p>In the application and promotion of scientific research and public welfare activities, Dr. Cao Chunxiang co-founded the "Spatial Information Technology Application Research Center for Public Health" in 2003 in collaboration with the Academy of Military Medical Sciences. She has tirelessly promoted the application of domestic satellite data and remote sensing technologies while jointly establishing 10 regional sub-centers across Beijing, Shanghai, Chengdu, Hebei, Shenzhen, Fujian, Jiangxi, Inner Mongolia, Shaanxi, and Guizhou. These sub-centers have provided platforms for talent cultivation, training, and the implementation of scientific research outcomes using virtual reality technologies.
                                                        Dr. Cao has effectively utilized social resources to complete eight "Mu Us Sandy Land Geostationary Synchronous Remote Sensing Scientific Experiments," obtaining first-hand data for desertification diagnostics. She has also been actively involved in ecological construction efforts in Inner Mongolia's "One Lake, Two Seas" initiative, conducting six field investigations and scientific experiments over the past four years.
                                                        To further promote the application of domestic satellite data and provide substantial scientific support for industry sectors, Dr. Cao led a team of experts and scholars from nine institutions specializing in wetland studies to develop China's first "Wetland Ecosystem Evaluation Index System." This system has been used to assess the functions, health, and value of 73 international wetlands and several nationally important wetlands across China.

                                                    <p>Dr. Cao Chunxiang, after returning to China, dedicated over a decade of research and officially proposed the cross-disciplinary field of Environmental Health Remote Sensing Diagnosis to the global community in 2011. In 2013, she established the Environmental Health Remote Sensing Laboratory at the State Key Laboratory of Remote Sensing Science. Through international collaborative working groups, she initiated the annual "International Academic Symposium on Environmental Health Remote Sensing Diagnosis," providing a platform for students and scholars to engage in international cooperation and exchange. Her scientific contributions include nearly 300 published papers, with over 100 SCI-indexed articles. In 2013, she co-authored a paper with a renowned U.S. professor in the journal *Nature Climate Change* titled “Temperature and Vegetation Seasonality Diminishment over Northern Lands,” marking a breakthrough for remote sensing research in a *Nature* sub-journal. Additionally, a series of monographs titled *Environmental Health Remote Sensing Diagnosis*, *Environmental Health Remote Sensing Diagnosis Indicator System*, *Key Technologies in Environmental Health Remote Sensing Diagnosis*, *Environmental Health Remote Sensing Diagnosis System*, and *Typical Applications in Environmental Health Remote Sensing Diagnosis* have been published after over a decade of work. Recommendations submitted to address national strategic needs have received endorsements from provincial and ministerial-level leaders.</p>
