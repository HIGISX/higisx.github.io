									<p>The spatial data intelligence model is a comprehensive basic model for the systematic, comprehensive and in-depth analysis and processing of multimodal, massive and heterogeneous spatial data based on the cross-disciplinary and multifaceted technological means of geography, informatics, mathematics, physics, artificial intelligence and big data, and the integration of spatial, computational and systemic thinking into a single model. The spatial data intelligence model can not only efficiently integrate all kinds of spatial data resources, but also realises the fusion and cross-application of multi-source data, intelligently extract the potential value and laws of spatial data, and provide accurate spatial information services and decision-making support for various industries. The spatial data intelligence model covers the main development directions of data perception, data management, data analysis and data security, and realises all-round intelligent processing and application of spatial data through comprehensive perception, fine management, in-depth analysis and security of data. The spatial data intelligence grand model not only focuses on spatial data acquisition and perception, but also on spatial data storage, management and in-depth analysis, as well as data privacy and security.</p>
									
								
									<p>Compared with traditional artificial intelligence models, the spatial data intelligence model has the following significant features: firstly, it realizes multi-source spatial data fusion, integrates spatial data from multiple sources such as GIS, remote sensing technology, sensor networks, etc., and achieves all-round, multi-dimensional spatial information acquisition and analysis; secondly, it has the ability of cross-field cross-application, which is not only confined to the field of computers, but also cross fused with Secondly, it has the ability of cross-field cross-application, which is not limited to the field of computer, but can also be cross-integrated with data and knowledge of other fields, such as mathematics, remote sensing, meteorology, geology, etc., to achieve cross-field comprehensive analysis and intelligent decision-making; furthermore, it has the ability of efficiently processing massive spatial data, and it can cope with large-scale, high-dimensional spatial data, and with the help of distributed computing and high-performance computing platforms, it can achieve rapid processing and analysis of massive data; lastly, it possesses the function of intelligent inference and prediction. By learning the laws and patterns of spatial data, it realises intelligent reasoning and prediction, providing users with accurate spatial information services and decision-making support.</p>
									<p>The emergence and development of intelligence models of spatial data have filled the technical gaps in the field of spatial data analysis and provided new ideas and methods for solving various complex problems. However, the development and application of realising intelligence models for spatial data still face three challenges: how to build effective models at different scales so that they have good generalisation ability and adaptability, given that data distribution and features show different regularities and change trends at different spatial scales; how to improve the effectiveness of large models so that they can efficiently and accurately handle massive spatial data. At the same time, how to improve the stability and reliability of generative intelligent models so that they can generate high-quality spatial data is also an important core technical challenge for spatial data intelligence models.</p>
